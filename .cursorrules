# Cursor Rules for deriv-bot

## Documentation Organization Rules

**CRITICAL: All documentation files (.md) MUST be placed in the appropriate subdirectory of `docs/`, NEVER in the root or package directories.**

### Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── strategies/          # Strategy documentation (how strategies work, parameters, etc.)
├── guides/              # User guides, tutorials, how-to guides
├── reports/             # Analysis reports, optimization results, findings
│   └── fixes/          # Bug fix reports and summaries
├── deployment/          # Deployment guides and setup instructions
├── architecture/        # Architecture documentation, design decisions, refactoring plans
└── archive/            # Archived/old documentation
```

### Rules for Generating Documentation

1. **Strategy Documentation** → `docs/strategies/`
   - Strategy explanations (e.g., `CRYPTOSCALP_V2_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`)
   - Strategy READMEs (e.g., `BB_SQUEEZE_README.md`)
   - Strategy lists (e.g., `ESTRATEGIAS_LISTADO.md`)

2. **User Guides** → `docs/guides/`
   - How-to guides (e.g., `BACKTEST_GUIDE.md`, `DASHBOARD_README.md`)
   - Setup guides (e.g., `DEMO_SETUP.md`, `QUICKSTART_WEB_UI.md`)
   - Analysis guides (e.g., `AI_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`)

3. **Reports** → `docs/reports/`
   - Analysis reports (e.g., `IMPROVEMENTS_ANALYSIS.md`, `LOSS_ANALYSIS_FINDINGS.md`)
   - Optimization results (e.g., `STRATEGY_OPTIMIZED_WIDER_SL1.md`)
   - Executive summaries (e.g., `RESUMEN_EJECUTIVO_MTF_LEVELS.md`)
   - Session summaries (e.g., `RESUMEN_SESION.md`)
   - Bug fix reports → `docs/reports/fixes/`

4. **Deployment Documentation** → `docs/deployment/`
   - Deployment guides (e.g., `DUAL_STRATEGY_SETUP.md`)
   - PM2 setup (e.g., `KELTNER_MR_PM2_SETUP.md`)

5. **Architecture Documentation** → `docs/architecture/`
   - Architecture docs (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
   - Design decisions (e.g., `MULTI_TIMEFRAME_DESIGN.md`)
   - Refactoring plans (e.g., `BACKTEST_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`)

### Files That Stay in Root

- `README.md` - Main project README (standard location)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Project changelog (standard location)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific rules (configuration file)

### Files That Stay in Package Directories

- `packages/*/README.md` - Package-specific READMEs (standard location)
- `packages/*/src/**/README.md` - Component-specific READMEs (standard location)

### When Creating New Documentation

**ALWAYS ask yourself:**
1. Is this a strategy doc? → `docs/strategies/`
2. Is this a guide/tutorial? → `docs/guides/`
3. Is this a report/analysis? → `docs/reports/`
4. Is this about deployment? → `docs/deployment/`
5. Is this about architecture? → `docs/architecture/`

**NEVER create .md files in:**
- Project root (except README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Package root directories (except package README.md)
- Source code directories (except component-specific README.md)

### Enforcement

If you see a .md file in the wrong location, immediately move it to the correct `docs/` subdirectory and update any references to it.
